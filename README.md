# NOVA ‚Äî The Fee-Free, Standalone Voice Assistant

> **Status:** üöß In Development

NOVA is a standalone, cross-platform voice assistant designed to be a **showstopper-quality application** ‚Äî not just a prototype. Unlike many hobby projects, NOVA aims for modern UI design, natural conversation flow, and robust offline capabilities, all without recurring fees for cloud services.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Free & Open-Source**  
  - No reliance on paid APIs for core functionality
  - Local speech recognition and TTS wherever possible

- **Modern Voice Interaction**  
  - Speech-to-text with high accuracy
  - Natural language understanding (NLU)
  - Context memory for follow-up commands
  - Text-to-speech with natural-sounding voices

- **Attractive UI**  
  - Cross-platform desktop application
  - Smooth animations and modern design
  - Chat-style conversation display

- **Extensible Skills**  
  - Reminder management
  - Weather info (using free APIs)
  - Local file searches
  - System commands (open apps, adjust volume, etc.)
  - Fun commands (jokes, trivia)

- **Privacy-First**  
  - Local processing preferred
  - User control over any network connections

  - Persistence layer still in development

- Evaluating open-source speech-to-text engines:
  - Whisper
  - Vosk
- Prototyping text-to-speech with:
  - pyttsx3
  - Coqui TTS
- Planning the UI:
  - Electron (Node.js + HTML/CSS/JS)
- Designing the NLP intent system:
  - spaCy
  - HuggingFace transformers
- Exploring Dockerization for modular components

## üîß Planned Tech Stack

| Component            | Proposed Tools              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Speech-to-Text (STT)  | Whisper (via whisper.cpp)   |
| Text-to-Speech (TTS)  | Coqui TTS / pyttsx3         |
| NLP / Intent Parsing  | spaCy, Transformers         |
| UI                    | Electron + Node.js          |
| Database              | PostgreSQL or SQLite        |
| Containerization      | Docker                      |
| Orchestration (opt.)  | Temporal (if feasible)      |
| APIs                  | Free APIs like Open-Meteo   |

## üí° Why NOVA?

There are plenty of voice assistants out there, but:
- Most depend on paid cloud services
- Few respect user privacy
- Many feel like demos rather than polished products

NOVA aims to change that by being:
- Free
- Open-source
- Private
- Beautiful
- Extensible

## ü§ù Contributions

Right now, NOVA is a solo project in early development. Contributions will be welcome once the architecture stabilizes!

---

## License

To be determined (MIT / Apache 2.0 preferred).
